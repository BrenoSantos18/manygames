<h1>About the Game</h1>
<p>This is a game that contains other two games (for now). I developed it in python, with pygame lib.</p>

<h2>Gas Station</h2>
<p>This is the most complex game added till now, and the one that I put a big effort. It's quite simple: You work at a gas station, attending cars. If you don't attend them in time, they will leave.</p>
<p>For now, you can improve the abily  to put gas faster in the cars, but I have a few plans for the future.</p>
<h3;>Game Buttons</h>
<ul>
  <li>Tab --> Open the shop.</li>
  <li>Esc --> Open the menu.</li>
  <li>E --> Interact.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Drive Game</h2>
<p>This one is really basic, you just have to drive a car, while you avoid another cars. In the end of the run, there a finish line.</p>
